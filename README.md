# python-webscraping
My first attempt at web scraping using the Beautiful Soup library!

This program allows a user to enter a year between 1881 and 2018 
and returns the top rated movies from that year along with some information 
about them. Very simple program used to learn the fundamentals of Python 
and the basics of scraping the web for data.
